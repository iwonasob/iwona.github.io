I am a third year PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Mark Plumbley at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) of the University of Surrey. 

My research interests include machine learning and digital signal processing, with focus on applications to machine listening and environmental sound analysis.

Feel free to explore my research, publications, code and other things that inspire me.
