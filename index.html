I am a third year PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Mark Plumbley at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) of the University of Surrey.

My main research interests lie in the area of **Machine Listening**: combining machine learning and digital signal processing to extract meaningful information from sounds. In other words: I am developing methods for making sense of sounds around us, be it bird songs, city soundscapes or everyday sounds.

My main focus is on matrix factorization and deep learning methods.

Before joining CVSSP I worked for 3 years in Samsung Electronics R&D as a software engineer in Natural Language Processing group.

I invite you to explore my research, publications, code and other things that inspire me.
